## Model
With Cerebral you define the state of your application as a single model: a single state tree. This state tree manages *all* application state, whether from a server, like a list of users, or client side state, like the currently selected tab of a UI.

All state changes are reflected live in the debugger, giving you a complete picture of how your application behaves. You can even edit the state tree directly and see the changes immediately in your application's UI.

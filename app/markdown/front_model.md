### Model
With Cerebral you define the state of your application as a single model, a single state tree. This state tree can be divided into modules, but you will always have complete overview of all the state of the application using the debugger.

Any changes to the state is updated live in the debugger and you can make changes to the state tree directly to see how your application is affected by it.

## Get started

To give you a good experience starting new Cerebral projects we have created a **CLI** tool. You will use this tool for one simple thing: **Create a project!**.

First install the CLI:

`$ npm install cerebral-cli -g`

Now **cerebral** is a command available to you. Go to your development directory and type:

`$ cerebral new myAwesomeProject`

The CLI will now ask you some questions so please move on to get some more information on what to choose.

## Defining signals

The signals of Cerebral is where you define what should happen when a user interacts with the application, or some other event like a received websocket message. You can think of signals as a decision or behaviour tree. It allows you to express complex flows in a natural way. You will be able to read all the logic of the change in one file and Cerebral knows how the signal will run before it is even run. This allows the debugger to give you great insight into running signals and historic signals.

In the demo application there are already two signals defined.

### Controller

The Cerebral controller is where you define all the logic that wants to change the state of your application. This being a user interaction or some other event. The change is defined using **signals**. These signals defines a flow of **actions** that will be performed much like a behaviour tree.

The debugger knows about all the signals, when they trigger and what data goes through them, giving you really great insight into what happens when users are interacting with your application.

## Controller

The Cerebral controller is where you define all the logic that wants to change the state of your application. This being a user interaction or some other event. The logic to run is defined as a **signal**. These signals looks and behaves much like a decision tree. Like the model you can divide signals into modules.

The debugger knows when signals trigger and what data goes through them. This gives you great insight into what is actually going on inside your application.

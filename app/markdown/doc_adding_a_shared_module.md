## Adding a shared module
Cerebral has an ecosystem of modules and providers. It is easy to extend the functionality of Cerebral by using these concepts and we highly encourage to share what you build. One module is called **cerebral-module-http**. It is based on the [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) library and gives you a service that can talk to your server.

The demo application already has this module installed and you can see it instantiated with the **App** and **Devtools** module.

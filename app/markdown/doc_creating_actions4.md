As you can see there are no implementation details here, but you can clearly see what the application is doing. Even a person not familiar with code would be able to understand the details of this complexity.

#### Best practices
You have now gotten insight into how you can define your actions from scratch. When developing applications you will depend heavily on the **cerebral-addons** package to avoid creating new actions for every little state change. You will also start to create your own action factories, chains and even chain factories to be reused in different signals. You will be surprised how quickly Cerebral becomes more like describing behaviour with legoblocks, rather than implementing logic.

## View

Components get data from one or more state paths. When a change occurs in the model, Cerebral notifies the view layer about what paths have changed. Rendering is highly optimized since components only re-render if their registered state paths have actually changed.

The debugger lets you know all the current active state paths and what components are rendered when these state paths change.
